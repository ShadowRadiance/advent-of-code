# Advent of Code

Parent repo for all my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) shenanigans.

- `2021` I first heard about AoC and tried it out using ruby, my main work and play language at the time.
- `2022` I decided to use "modern c++" using only the STL to reacquaint myself with C++ after not using it since about C++11.
- `2023` I decided to learn Go by doing AoC in Go this year.
- `2024` Who knows?

Backfill:

- I'd like to go back and do AoC 2015-2020 with a variety of languages I either know and want to refresh or , such as:
  - javascript/typescript
  - c#/dotnet
  - java
- and to learn (more) about new languages, such as:
  - haskell
  - python
  - rust

Wish me luck!
